# Pattern 1:

Create a Pattern in the following order,
```
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```


* The approach is very simple. As we can see there is n rows and columns where the value of n=3. 
* Again rows are represented by i and columns are represented by j.
* Our task is to print  1 in every ith row at jth position.
* I have uploaded four different solutions of the above problem.
